# 1 About Remote KeyLess Entry(RKE)

## 1.1 Description
* Remote keyless entry (RKE) is an electronic access system that can be controlled from a distance. RKEs, which are typically used to remotely lock or unlock doors, require the end user to initiate an action that will cause a physical or software key fob to transmit a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock. Typically, the action is to press a button on a physical fob.
* A remote keyless entry car kit doesnâ€™t rely on a physical button or panel in order to get into your vehicle, but instead it has a sensor that detects your remote keyless key fob within a certain range of your vehicle. It then unlocks once you touch the door handle, but only while the key is nearby. Remote keyless entry cars also often allow for remote starting, as long as the remote key fob is within a short distance of the vehicle. Remote keyless communications are done through encrypted radio signals, and this can either be done through short range radio to a remote key fob in your pocket, or it can be hooked up to a smartphone system and can actually be controlled over cellular networks from anywhere in the world.
